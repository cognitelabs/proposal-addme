              <h1>Explanation of Services</h1>

<p>To help get in sync about how we understand the work we&rsquo;ll do, we offer the following explanation of our services.</p>








                <h2>Prototyping</h2>
                      <h3>Facilitate customer validation, to ensure app worth building</h3>
                      <p>A lot of products - and businesses - fail, not because the product was uninteresting, but because they don't have enough paying customers. There are a lot of reasons why this happens, but for early stage companies - that can't afford NOT to get customers quickly - the main reason is building the wrong thing for the wrong audience. We'll help you to mitigate that risk.</p>
                      <h3>Facilitate business model validation, to ensure the business can be viable</h3>
                      <p>While customer demand is the largest risk to a business, there are a lot of other factors that can break an early stage company. These includehave an unreliable cost structure, unproven distribution channels, to name a few. We'll help you identify and mitigate those risks.</p>
                      <h3>Develop user stories</h3>
                      <p>Products should be built for humans. And they should help them solve problems. User stories are mechanism for understanding software requirements from a user's perspective. We'll help you to understand your user's core goals and use them as the backbone for outlining the product roadmap.</p>
                      <h3>Develop user personas</h3>
                      <p>No product survives first contact with a user and no two users are the same. Peronas help to clarify who the ideal users are, and what their expectations are for the product.</p>

                <h2>Development</h2>
                      <h3>Develop product roadmap</h3>
                      <p>Once we've captured user stories and developed an interactive prototype, we'll transition those learnings into a product roadmap that we can use for release planning.</p>
                      <h3>Outline sprint plan</h3>
                      <p>Once the produt roadmap is complete, we'll outline a sprint plan to accomplish development within a few weeks. Sprints are two-week bursts of work, where working tested, working software is delivered until a release is complete.</p>
                      <h3>Release v1</h3>
                      <p>Once the market, product, and business model are validated, and the sprints completed, we'll release the first version of the product to your early access customers - people who want to buy the app from you (these are different from users - who might be using the app for free). </p>
